# Nexus-Appeals
Contains data collected using www.govinfo.gov's US Circuit Courts of Appeals case search 

While the appeals in this sample are publically available, the contents of the appeals contain incredibly personal information about the applicants which can oftentimes also be identifiable. Including their cases in this data set does slightly increase the exposure of these details. Therefore, if anyone finds this file in the future and would prefer an individual case be removed from the public sample here, they can indicate which case they would like removed via Github comment or email at tbelshee+nexusrequest[ at ]gmail.com with the subject 'Case Removal Request'.
